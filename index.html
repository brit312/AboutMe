                  <h2>Hello! My name is Brittani Loren Stokes, and here is a webpage that is all about me. I am originally from Chicago, Illinois, but my family moved to Westchester, IL by the time I was 5 years old. I am the youngest out of both of my siblings, and I am definitely the most spoiled one out of all of us. I love to read, play videos games, and listen to music! I am quiet when you first meet me, but once I get to know you I can definitely talk your ears off. If you would like to learn more about me please continue through the slides.</h2>
